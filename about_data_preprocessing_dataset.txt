Project detail:
1. Obtain a large classification database. The database needs to have at least 2
classes, more than 5 features and over 200 samples. Each group has to use
a unique dataset.
2. Provide a description of the dataset used including explanation of various
features.
3. Pre-process and clean the dataset as appropriate.
4. Use following approaches for classification of the dataset:
A. Logistic Regression
B. Decision Tree
C. Random Forest
D. SGD
E. SVM
5. Use GridSearchCV to tune the parameter of each of the above models. Can
you obtain better results in this step for any of the models? Discuss your
observations.
6. Randomly (or based on certain hypothesis) remove some features and
re-evaluate the models. Document your observations with respect to models
performances

Explaination:
1.)data preprocessing is done, and can check the notes within the coding
2.)for the first training we would use df_Encode and df_E_SN preprocessed dataset
        df_Encode for tree-based algo
        df_E_SN for non tree-based algo as it preformed standlization & normalization to miniz the range of value
3.) can use the auto selection tool provide or manually selecting or both to select the features you want
4.) preform training again, and see the results

# I my opinion, no need to rush for the best result, Explaination is more important, as long as you can explain it, it will be fine.
Good luck
